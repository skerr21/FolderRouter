# FolderRouter
Route folders based on extensions of files inside


This is a simple application that allows you to set up and save folder locations to monitor. You can monitor the locations for if any folder with ".xxx" etension is moved to it, and then move that folder and the files inside of it to a new location.

Just wanted to keep track of my progress
